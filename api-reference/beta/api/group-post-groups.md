# Create group

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [group](../resources/group.md) as specified in the request body. You can create one of the following groups:

* Office 365 Group (unified group)
* Security group

This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](group-get.md) and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

>**Note**: To create a [team](../resources/team.md), first create a group then add a team to it, see [create team](../api/team-put-teams.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /groups
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

The following table shows the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource to specify when you create a group. 

| Property | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| displayName | string | The name to display in the address book for the group. Required. |
| mailEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for mail-enabled groups. Required. |
| mailNickname | string | The mail alias for the group. Required. |
| securityEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for security-enabled groups, including Office 365 groups. Required. |
| owners | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the owners for the group at creation time. Optional. |
| members | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the members for the group at creation time. Optional. |

> **Note:** Groups created using the Microsoft Azure portal always have **securityEnabled** initially set to `true`.

Because the **group** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the group while creating it.

>**Note:** Creating an Office 365 Group programmatically without a user context and  without specifying owners will create the group anonymously.  Doing so can result in the associated SharePoint Online site not being created automatically until further manual action is taken.  

Specify other writable properties as necessary for your group. For more information, see the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource.

### groupTypes options

Use the **groupTypes** property to control the type of group and its membership, as shown below:

| Type of group | Assigned membership | Dynamic membership |
|:--------------|:------------------------|:---------------|
| Office 365 (aka unified group)| `["Unified"]` | `["Unified","DynamicMembership"]`
| Dynamic | `[]` (_null_) | `["DynamicMembership"]`|

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group.
