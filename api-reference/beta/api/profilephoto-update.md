# Update profilephoto

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the photo for any user in the tenant including the signed-in user, or the specified group or contact. Since there
is currently a limit of 4MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the size of the photo
you can add to under 4MB.

Use only PUT for this operation in the beta version.

> **Note** The update photo operation in beta supports only the user's work or school mailboxes and not personal mailboxes.
