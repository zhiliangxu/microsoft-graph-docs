|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|allowPublicClient|Boolean| Specifies if the application can act as a public client. For example,  an installed application running on a mobile device. Default value is *false*. |
|api|[apiApplication](../resources/apiapplication.md)| Specifies settings for an API application. |
|appRoles|[appRole](../resources/approle.md) collection|The collection of application roles that an application may declare. These roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals. Not nullable.|
|applicationAliases|String collection| The URIs that identify the application. For more information see, [Application Objects and Service Principal Objects](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-application-objects/). The *any* operator is required for filter expressions on multi-valued properties. Not nullable. |
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset| The date and time the application was registered. |
|deletedDateTime|DateTimeOffset| The date and time the application was deleted. |
|displayName|String|The display name for the application. |
|id|String|The unique identifier for the application. Inherited from [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md). Key. Not nullable. Read-only. |

|preAuthorizedApplications|[preAuthorizedApplication](../resources/preauthorizedapplication.md) collection| Lists applications and requested permissions for implicit consent.

|requiredResourceAccess|[requiredResourceAccess](../resources/requiredresourceaccess.md) collection|Specifies resources that this application requires access to and the set of OAuth permission scopes and application roles that it needs under each of those resources. This pre-configuration of required resource access drives the consent experience. Not nullable.|
