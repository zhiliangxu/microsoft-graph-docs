# assignLicense

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add or remove licenses for the user to enable or disable their use of Microsoft cloud offerings. For example, an organization can have an Office 365 Enterprise E3 subscription with 100 licenses, and this request assigns one of those licenses to a specific user.

To learn more about subscriptions and licenses, see this [Technet article](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt765146.aspx).

To get the subscriptions available in the directory, perform a [GET subscribedSkus request](subscribedsku-list.md).
