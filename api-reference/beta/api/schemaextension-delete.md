# Delete schemaExtension

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete the definition of a [schema extension](../resources/schemaextension.md).

Only the app that created the schema extension (owner app) can delete the schema extension definition, 
and only when the extension is in the **InDevelopment** state. Deleting a schema extension definition does not affect 
accessing custom data that has been added to resource instances based on that definition.
