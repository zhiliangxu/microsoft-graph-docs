# Get contact

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of contact object.

There are two scenarios where an app can get a contact in another user's contact folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a contact folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-get-shared-contacts-folders).


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
A [contact](../resources/contact.md) in the user's mailbox.
```http
GET /me/contacts/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}
```
A [contact](../resources/contact.md) from a top level [contactFolder](../resources/contactfolder.md) of the user's.
```http
GET /me/contactfolders/{Id}/contacts/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactfolders/{id}/contacts/{id}
```
A [contact](../resources/contact.md) contained in a child folder of a [contactFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md).  The 
example below shows one level of nesting, but a contact can be located in a child of a child and so on.
```http
GET /me/contactFolder/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../contacts/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/contacts/{id}
```
