# List bookingBusinesses

 [!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a collection of [bookingbusiness](../resources/bookingbusiness.md) objects that has been created for the tenant.

This operation returns only the **id** and **displayName** of each Bookings business in the collection. For performance considerations, it does not return other properties. You can get the other properties of a Bookings business by specifying its **id** in a [GET](bookingbusiness-get.md) operation.

You can also query for Bookings businesses by specifying a string in a `query` parameter to do substring matching among the businesses of a tenant. See an [example](#request-2) below.
