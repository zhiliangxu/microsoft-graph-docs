# Get directory objects from a list of ids

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Returns the directory objects specified in a list of ids.  NOTE: The directory objects returned are the full objects containing **all** their properties. The `$select` query option is not available for this operation.

Some common uses for this function are to:

* Resolve ids returned by functions (that return collections of ids) such as [getMemberObjects](/graph/api/directoryobject-getmemberobjects.md?view=graph-rest-beta) or [getMemberGroups](/graph/api/directoryobject-getmembergroups.md?view=graph-rest-beta)  to their backing directory objects.
* Resolve ids persisted in an external store by the application to their backing directory objects.

If not specified, the default is [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-beta), which contains all of the resource types defined in the directory. Any object that derives from [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-beta) may be specified in the collection; for example: [user](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-beta), [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-beta), [device](/graph/api/resources/device?view=graph-rest-beta), and so on.

If not specified, the default is [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-beta), which contains all of the resource types defined in the directory, except for references to a [Cloud Solution Provider](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-solution-provider) partner organization. The values are not case-sensitive.|
