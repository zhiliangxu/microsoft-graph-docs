# List contacts

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get contacts in the user's mailbox.

There are two scenarios where an app can get contacts in another user's contact folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a contact folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-get-shared-contacts-folders).


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the contacts in a user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/contacts
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contacts
```

To get contacts in a specific folder in the user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/contactfolders/{Id}/contacts
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactfolders/{id}/contacts

GET /me/contactFolder/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../contacts
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/contacts
```
## Optional query parameters
You can use the `$filter` query parameter to filter contacts based on their email addresses:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
``` http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/contacts?$filter=emailAddresses/any(a:a/address eq 'garth@contoso.com')
```

Note that you can use `$filter`, `any`, and the `eq` operator on only the **address** sub-property of instances in an **emailAddresses** collection. That is, you cannot filter on the **name** or any other sub-property of an instance of **emailAddresses**, nor can you apply any other operator or function with `filter`, such as `ne`, `le`, and `startswith()`.

For general information on the `$filter` query parameter, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [contact](../resources/contact.md) objects in the response body.
