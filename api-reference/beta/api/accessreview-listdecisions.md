# List accessReview decisions

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In the Azure AD [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, retrieve the decisions of an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.

Note that a recurring access review will not have a `decisions` relationship.  Instead, the caller must navigate the `instance` relationship to find an `accessReview` object for a current or past instance of the access review.
