# Get device

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the properties and relationships of a device object.

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **device** instance.
