# Create Session

Use this API to create a new workbook session. 

Excel APIs can be called in one of two modes: 

1. Persistent session - All changes made to the workbook are persisted (saved). This is the usual mode of operation. 
2. Non-persistent session - Changes made by the API are not saved to the source location. Instead, the Excel backend server keeps a temporary copy of the file that reflects the changes made during that particular API session. When the Excel session expires, the changes are lost. This mode is useful for apps that need to do analysis or obtain the results of a calculation or a chart image, but not affect the document state.   

To represent the session in the API, use the `workbook-session-id: {session-id}` header. 

>**Note:** The session header is not required for an Excel API to work. However, we recommend that you use the session header to improve performance. If you don't use a session header, changes made during the API call _are_ persisted to the file.
