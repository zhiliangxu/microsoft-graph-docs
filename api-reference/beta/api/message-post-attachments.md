# Add attachment

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to add an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) to a message. 

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource. 

You can add an attachment to an existing message by posting to its attachments collection, or to a new 
message that is being [drafted](../api/user-post-messages.md), or [created and sent on the fly](../api/user-sendmail.md).

Since there is currently a limit of 4MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the 
size of the attachment you can add to under 4MB.
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadWrite |
