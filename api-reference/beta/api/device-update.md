# Update device

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of a device.

Only certain properties of a device can be updated through approved Mobile Device Managment (MDM) apps.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application | Not supported |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /devices/{id}
```

> Note: The "id" in the request is the "id" property of the device, not the "deviceId" property.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for the [device](../resources/device.md) properties that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|accountEnabled|Boolean| **true** if the account is enabled; otherwise, **false**. |
|operatingSystem|String|The type of operating system on the device.|
|operatingSystemVersion|String|The version of the operating system on the device|
|displayName|String|The display name for the device.|
|isCompliant|Boolean|**true** if the device complies with Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies; otherwise, **false**. This can only be updated by Intune for any device OS type or by an [approved MDM app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm) for Windows OS devices. |
|isManaged|Boolean|**true** if the device is managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) app; otherwise, **false**. This can only be updated by Intune for any device OS type or by an [approved MDM app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm) for Windows OS devices. |

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **device** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
