# Force domain deletion

Deletes a domain using an asynchronous long-running operation.

The following actions are performed as part of this operation:

* Updates the `userPrincipalName`, `mail`, and `proxyAddresses` properties of `users` with references to the deleted domain to use the initial onmicrosoft.com domain.

* Updates the `mail` property of `groups` with references to the deleted domain to use the initial onmicrosoft.com domain.

* Updates the `identifierUris` property of `applications` with references to the deleted domain to use the initial onmicrosoft.com domain.

* If the number of objects to be renamed is greater than 1000, an error is returned.

* If one of the `applications` to be renamed is a multi-tenant app, an error is returned.

After the domain deletion completes, API operations for the deleted domain will return a HTTP 404 status code. To verify deletion of a domain, you can perform a [get domain](domain-get.md) operation.
