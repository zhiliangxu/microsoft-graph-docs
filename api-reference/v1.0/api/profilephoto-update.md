# Update profilephoto

Update the photo for the signed-in **user**, or the specified **group** or **contact**. Since there

you can add to under 4MB.

You can use either PATCH or PUT for this operation in version 1.0.

> **Note** This operation in version 1.0 supports only a user's work or school mailboxes and not personal mailboxes.
