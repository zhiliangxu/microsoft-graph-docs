# Get mailFolder

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a message folder object.

There are two scenarios where an app can get another user's mail folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a mail folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-share-messages-folders).


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
