# Restore deleted item

Restores a recently deleted item from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md). 

Currently, deleted items functionality is only supported for the [group](../resources/group.md) and [user](../resources/user.md) resources. If an item was accidentally deleted, you can fully restore the item.

A recently deleted item will remain available for up to 30 days. After 30 days, the item is permanently deleted.
