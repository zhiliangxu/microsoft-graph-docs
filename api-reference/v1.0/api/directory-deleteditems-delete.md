# Permanently delete item

Permanently deletes an item from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md).

Currently, deleted items functionality is only supported for the [group](../resources/group.md) and [user](../resources/user.md) resources. You can permanently delete an item from deleted items. But, once an item is permanently deleted, it **cannot** be restored.
