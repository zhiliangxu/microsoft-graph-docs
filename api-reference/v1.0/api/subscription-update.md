# Update subscription

Renew a subscription by extending its expiry time.

Subscriptions expire after a length of time that varies by resource type. In order to avoid missing notifications, an app should renew its subscriptions well in advance of their expiry date. See [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) for maximum length of a subscription for each resource type.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource | Delegated (work or school account) | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|[contact](../resources/contact.md) | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read |
|[driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) (user's personal OneDrive) | Not supported | Files.ReadWrite | Not supported |
|[driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) (OneDrive for Business) | Files.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Files.ReadWrite.All |
|[event](../resources/event.md) | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read |
|[group](../resources/group.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Group.Read.All |
|[group conversation](../resources/conversation.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Not supported |
|[message](../resources/message.md) | Mail.Read | Mail.Read | Mail.Read |
|[security alert](../resources/alert.md) | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All |
|[user](../resources/user.md) | User.Read.All | User.Read.All | User.Read.All |

> **Note:** There are additional limitations for subscriptions on OneDrive and Outlook items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing subscriptions (getting, updating, and deleting subscriptions).

- On personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other driveItem objects in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

- In Outlook, delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox. That means, for example, you cannot use the delegated permission Calendars.Read to subscribe to events in another userâ€™s mailbox.
- To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in _shared or delegated_ folders:

  - Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in a folder or mailbox of _any_ user in the tenant.
  - Do not use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do **not** support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders.
