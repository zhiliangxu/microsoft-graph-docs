# Azure AD Credentials Usage Report overview

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The authentication methods usage report helps an organization understand how their end users are using Azure Active Directory capabilities such as self-service password reset and Multi-Factor Authentication. Using this report, you can gain insights into how end users are registering and using these capabilities using the various authentication methods provided by Azure Active Directory. For example, you can use these reports to gather feedback when you are rolling out these capabilities within your organization. These reports will provide insights such as which authentication methods are more successful for your organization, what kind of errors the end users are running into as well as help you determine what kind of campaign you need to run to help your end users adopt these capabilities.
